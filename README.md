# My Story
I embarked on my journey with Python in 2024, building upon a solid foundation in programming cultivated through four years of computer science studies at Voronezh State University. 
Python captivated me with its code readability and the supportive community it boasts. 
Alongside mastering Python and the fundamentals of web development, I am actively delving into Git, Docker, exploring relational databases and SQL, as well as getting acquainted with NoSQL databases.
